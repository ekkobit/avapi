### Pandas data frames from Alpha Vantage

## Documentation

There are other python wrappers for the alpha vantage API, such as [alphavantage](https://pypi.org/project/alphavantage/), [alpha-vantage-downloader](https://pypi.org/project/alpha-vantage-downloader/), [alpha_vantage](https://pypi.org/project/alpha_vantage/) and [alphavantage-wrapper](https://pypi.org/project/alphavantage-wrapper/). They all have in common that they have different functions for each of the data types that Alpha Vantage offers. This may be less practical when downloading multiple data types at multiple resolutions in one session. Avapi has a single function that can download any data type from Alpha Vantage: avapi.get_data() takes \*\*kwargs as input and outputs a  dictionary, unless datatype="csv" is given, in which case a csv file is saved. If the data type is time series, avapi.to_df() converts it to a Pandas data frame. The intention is a simple and flexible way to get data from Alpha Vantage into python.    

### Installation

```shell
pip install avapi
```
### Before use

Follow instructions on the [Alpha vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co) website to get a free API-key.  The [docs](https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/) provide all necessary info for Ã  la carte downloading of historical data and indicators. Please checkout Alpha Vantage [support](https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#support) and read through the [Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#support).

#### Examples

The "demo" api-key only works for these specific examples. If you modify the code you also need to provide your own api-key.

##### Single file download

```python
import avapi as aa
import pandas as pd

data = aa.get_data(function='VWAP', symbol='MSFT',
                   interval='15min', apikey='demo')

df = aa.to_df(data)
df.head()
```

##### Multiple files download

There are limits for free accounts: up to 5 API requests per minute and 500 requests per day.  In loops, if you don't incorporate time.sleep(), you might get errors.

```python
import avapi as aa
import pandas as pd
from time import sleep

data_path = 'data/'

data_calls = [

{
 'function': 'TIME_SERIES_DAILY',
 'symbol': 'MSFT',
 'apikey': 'demo',
 'datatype': 'csv',
},
{
 'function':'TIME_SERIES_INTRADAY',
 'symbol': 'MSFT',
 'interval': '5min',
 'apikey': 'demo',
 'datatype': 'csv',

}
]


for call in data_calls:
    save_to = data_path + call['function'] + '_' + call['symbol'] + '.csv'
    data = aa.get_data(save_to=save_to, **call)
    sleep(15)
```

##### Unexpected results

If you get unexpected results, you may check the latest, original response from the Alpha Vantage server in the following way:

```python
response = aa.response()
print(response)
```



## Issues

- [x] **Issue 1 -** Fulfill Alpha Vantage's request to preserve content of JSON/CSV responses in both success and error cases.
- [x] **Issue 2 -** Make get_data() work with \*\*kwargs.
